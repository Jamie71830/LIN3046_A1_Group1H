## Script:

AMY
Maybe if I immediately lost all my
limbs, and my eyesight and hearing, and I was just like a human potato. I’d be like, “remember when I had my limbs and could see and hear? Those were the best four years.”
MOLLY
Or if I was convicted of a crime I
didn’t commit and spent the rest of my life in a Thai prison.
AMY
If I spent the rest of my life
reading in the backseat of a car.
MOLLY
You do get so carsick.
They walk INSIDE, where it’s even rowdier. Molly pushes her way through the chaos--
MOLLY (CONT’D) Where was this energy at my
inauguration assembly, folks?!
INT. PRINCIPAL BROWN’S OFFICE - DAY
Molly and Amy stop outside PRINCIPAL BROWN’s office as he finishes the morning announcements on a PA SYSTEM.
PRINCIPAL BROWN ...and please do not attempt a
senior prank. I have eyes and ears every where and you will not succeed. I don’t wanna have to suspend you right before graduation. I hope I never have to see any of you again. All right, signing off. Gooooo Crocketts!
He turns off the PA system, putting it away, when--
MOLLY Principal Brown.
PRINCIPAL BROWN (”kill me”)
Molly. Amy. What’s shaking?
(CONTINUED)

 CONTINUED:
MOLLY
I’m trying to make the transition
to next year’s student government President as seamless as possible so when I’m up in New Haven--
PRINCIPAL BROWN Yale. You can say just Yale.
AMY
Our class’s official policy is to
not discuss where people are attending next year. We don’t want anyone to feel insecure.
PRINCIPAL BROWN Very thoughtful.
MOLLY
Anyway, I need to go over the end-
of-year budget numbers we have.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
Really? Can’t you just do it with
Nick? He’s your Vice President.
MOLLY
We both know Nick only ran for VP
because they plan the dances. That position is basically a popularity contest. He’s useless.
PRINCIPAL BROWN
Ladies, it’s the last day. We did
it! We got you through high school. He stands and walks over to them.
PRINCIPAL BROWN (CONT’D) Can’t we just graduate? Head off to
college? Celebrate this wonderful achievement?
He starts slowly closing the door.
PRINCIPAL BROWN (CONT’D) Let’s just focus on getting through
the rest of the day without anything horrible happening, okay?
MOLLY
I’m sorry, are you shutting the
door on us? This isn’t subtle. (MORE)

MOLLY (CONT'D)
You can’t just close the door. We
will persist--
He shuts it in their faces.
INT. HALLWAYS - CROCKETT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
Molly and Amy walk back down the hallway. Amy watches as NICK holds court with his friends TANNER and THEO and a TON OF GIRLS all trying to flirt with him. Nick RAMS his head into his locker, popping it open. Everyone laughs.
AMY
It is kinda impressive. Nick’s like
the great equalizer. Delegates from every group of girls are casting their ballots for his penis.
A HOT GIRL, TRIPLE A, giggles at Nick, touching his chest.
MOLLY
And Triple A takes the lead!
AMY
Don’t call her that.
MOLLY
Everyone calls her that. She gave
“roadside assistance” to three senior guys last year.
AMY
And do you hear them getting
degrading nicknames?
MOLLY
They call Sam Ross “Dick Splinter.”
AMY
That’s not derogatory. It’s a
factual description. Sam Ross had an actual splinter in his penis.
INT. MISS FINE’S CLASSROOM - DAY
Molly and Amy walk up to MISS FINE (30, their teacher crush) sitting at the teacher’s desk.
MOLLY/AMY Hi Miss Fine!
(CONTINUED)
5.

 CONTINUED:
Miss Fine holds up a completed NY TIMES CROSSWORD.
MISS FINE
Seven minutes twenty seconds.
Molly and Amy groan and hold up the SAME CROSSWORD.
AMY Nine forty-three.
MISS FINE
What am I gonna do without you two
next year? Nobody else here even attempts the Thursday puzzle.
MOLLY
We’ll still send you our Sunday
times. Amy and I are gonna Skype the crossword every weekend.
MISS FINE
You know what? I’m gonna give you
guys my number. If you have any questions or need anything next year, text me.
They try to play it cool, but this is the best moment of their lives. They each try to hand her their own phone, but Molly boxes Amy out and gets hers into Miss Fine’s hands.
Triple A walks in and rolls her eyes--
TRIPLE A
I thought phones weren’t allowed in
class, Miss Fine. Unless there’s an exception for ass kissers?
MISS FINE
You better put a dollar in the
swear jar.
(holding out her hand)
The swear jar is my hand. Give me a dollar.
Triple A shrugs innocently.
TRIPLE A
I’m so sorry, these shorts don’t
have pockets.
GEORGE and ALAN, two magnificently dramatic theater kids, push their way toward their seats--

GEORGE EXCUSE ME!
(as he sits)
There is no spacial awareness at this school...
Molly and Amy squeal over Miss Fine’s number as they settle into their desks. HOPE (gorgeous, intimidating) watches.
HOPE Hey, Amy.
(Amy turns)
Did you just score your teacher’s phone number?
AMY Yeah!
HOPE
(fatally sarcastically)
Nice.
Hope smirks at her and settles back into her seat. Amy frowns, stung.
Theo and Tanner drop into their seats behind Molly and Amy. Theo calls up to Miss Fine--
THEO
Miss Fine, you gonna come party
with us tonight?
MOLLY
Did you just ask Miss Fine if she
wants to party with you? You think she wants to watch you and your friends get drunk and break things?
THEO
Sorry, I was having a conversation
with her, you were not a part of this--
MOLLY Sit down, Theo.
Theo glares but sits just as sweet, eager JARED (18) walks in. He’s decked out in the most expensive stuff possible, but tries too hard to ever be truly cool.
(CONTINUED)

JARED
What up Miss Fine! Just wanted to
drop off a last-day present for my favorite teach!
MISS FINE
Jared, you are not my student.
JARED
I’ve heard great things.
(to the class)
And everybody else got their graduation gifts, right?
