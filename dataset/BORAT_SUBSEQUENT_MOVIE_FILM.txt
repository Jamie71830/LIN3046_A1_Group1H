My name a Borat. My life not nice. But how did I end up like this?
Fourteen years ago, I release a moviefilm, which was great success in US&A... But Kazakhstan become a laughing stock around the world.
Our exports of potassium and pubis plummet. Many brokers leapt from our tallest skyscrapers.
Since Running of Jew had been cancelled...
All Kazakhstan had left was our Holocaust Remembrance Day, where we celebrated our brave soldiers who manned the camps... 
I was blame for Kazakhstanâ€™s failure... and banned from ever make reportings again...
