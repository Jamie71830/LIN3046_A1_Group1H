I’m sorry.
I love this movie. They shot this on Staten Island.
This movie makes no sense. Why would the government make a purge legal?
Clearly to let them blow off some steam.
That’s why you go to the spa.
Or the therapist.
Or get your nails done.
Or murder some folks.
Come on, I brought Tara over so we could get out of this basement. Let’s go out. Let’s go dancing.
I love dancing.
Let’s do something!
We don’t go out.
We don’t dance.
The Purge is not enough for you?
Does anybody else like dancing?
Yes me! I love dancing.
I like it.
You do?
Yes. He’s a really good dancer.
What’s your favorite move?
It’s kind of like a shake.
A shake?
I don’t know. I just do whatever the music tells me to do.
There’s nothing but douchebags at these clubs.
I love it here, man. It’s safe.
You just sit here all day and smoke weed and jerk each other off.
That sounds amazing.
I’ve never been jerked off by any of my friends.
Me neither.
I like your tattoos.
