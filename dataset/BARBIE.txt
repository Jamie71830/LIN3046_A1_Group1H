Hi Barbie!
Hi Allan!
(V.O) There are no multiples of Allan.
He’s just Allan.
I’m still confused about that?
Hi Ken!
Hey Barbie! Check me out!
KEN! NO!
Ken?
Oh Hi Barbie... How much of that did you see?
Let’s get you up on your feet.
Wow you are so strong!
Looks like this beach was a little too much beach for you, Ken.
If I wasn’t severely injured I’d beach you off right now, Ken.
Oh, I’ll beach-off with you any day, Ken!
 You’re on, Ken! Let’s beach-off!
Anyone who wants to beach him off has to beach me off first.
I will beach both of you off at the same time!
No ones gonna beach anyone off!
