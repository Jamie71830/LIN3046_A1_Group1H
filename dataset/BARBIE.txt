Hi Ken.
Ken Ryan Gosling groans, waving his hand in dismissal.
Hi Ken!
Hi Barbie! Hi Ken!
Hi Barbie! Hi Ken!
Hi Ken!

 KEN KINGSLEY
Hi Ken! I got us both ice creams!
Cool.
Hi Ken!
KEN RYAN GOSLING
BARBIE ANA
Everyone says “Hi Barbie” and “Hi Ken” over and over to each other. Way out in the sea, a few Mermaid Barbies emerge:
BARBIE MERMAID Hi Barbies!
ALL BARBIES AND KENS
Hi Barbie!
(she disappears beneath
the waves) Bye Barbie!
ALLAN Hi Barbie!
BARBIE MARGOT
Hi Allan!
And there’s Allan in his striped shirt. Everything stops.
HELLEN MIRREN (V.O.) There are no multiples of Allan.
He’s just Allan.
ALLAN
I’m still confused about that?
On shore, Ken Ryan Gosling comes sprinting down the sand.
KEN RYAN GOSLING BARBIE MARGOT KEN RYAN GOSLING
HI BARBIE!
Hi Ken!
Hey Barbie! Check me out!
Ken Ryan Gosling, who seems to only exist when Barbie is paying attention to him, runs into the surf, like INTO it, and flies backward, head over heels, into the air with his surfboard and...lands HARD.

 ALLAN (Hecuba at Troy)
KEN! NO!
Barbie Margot and her other Barbie friends jump up and swiftly coordinate a rescue mission, while the other Kens stand around helplessly. Ken Kingsley protects his ice creams.
BARBIE MARGOT (concerned)
Ken?
KEN RYAN GOSLING
Oh Hi Barbie... How much of that
did you see?
BARBIE MARGOT We saw the whole thing!
BARBIE ANA
Let’s get you up on your feet.
Barbie Margot and Barbie Ana lift Ken up.
KEN RYAN GOSLING Wow you are so strong!
Meanwhile, Ken Simu laughs derisively:
KEN SIMU
Looks like this beach was a little
too much beach for you, Ken.
KEN RYAN GOSLING
If I wasn’t severely injured I’d
beach you off right now, Ken.
KEN SIMU
Oh, I’ll beach-off with you any
day, Ken!
KEN RYAN GOSLING You’re on, Ken! Let’s beach-off!
KEN KINGSLEY (on Ken Ryan’s side)
Anyone who wants to beach him off has to beach me off first.
KEN SIMU
I will beach both of you off at the
same time!
9.

KEN RYAN GOSLING (getting upset)
You don’t even know how to beach your SELF off how are you going to beach all of us off??
KEN SIMU
Why are you getting emotional?!
BARBIE MARGOT
Come on, Kens, nobody is going to
beach anyone off!
