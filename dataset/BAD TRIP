The fuck you lookin' at?
You tell me?
Jesus Christ, Jake. Enough with the bitchin'.
Hey, you're not the one who was getting eyeballed by the asshole at the front desk.
You ask stupid questions. I'd eyeball your ass too.
So now what? We planning to stay here forever?
You got a better idea? We need to stay low until this shit blows over.
Are you crazy? You just said we have to stay low.
Take your hand off me before I fuckin' break it.
But the cops...?
Fuck'em... No way they're gonna find us here. But hey, in case there pathetic asses actually do...
...we're not going down quietly.
Feels good I bet? Holding that gun.
Hello Jacob.
Who the fuck are you? How'd you get in here?
My how you forget. Are we going to play this game everytime I see you?
I've never seen you before.
Oh, but you have...
I'm standing outside First National Bank where minutes ago two armed men stormed in and took several people hostage.
Please, I don't wanna die. I beg you... please.
One hostage is dead. And now the manhunt begins for the two suspects.
Remember me now, Jacob?
Stay back! I'm warning you!
Going to shoot me again?
I swear, I'll pull the trigger.
Go ahead. You weren't this hesitant the first time.
You can't kill what's already dead.
Matt! Help me! Matt!
He can't save you.
Jesus, you're not real. You're just my imagination. You're not real. You're just my imagination...
