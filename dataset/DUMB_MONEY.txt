So, I’m here and I do not see anything happening. At all.
That’s what I’m having trouble understanding. What is the reason for the delay? Specifically?
I know Mr. Plotkin, I’m so sorry, it’s just--
We closed in November and got all the permit applications in before the holidays.
Once we get the final stamp of approval from the Review Board next week, you’ll be off to the races.
We couldn’t get the trucks here a little early? Get ‘em started.
Miami Beach ordinances--
Yeah, but is anyone really enforcing those right now?
Believe me, Mr. Plotkin, I know you’re eager to move in.
Oh no, that’s not--
Hold on a sec, will ya?
Hey-o.
You see what’s going on with GME?
More of these idiots?
A lot more.
No way they’ll hold much longer.
Gabe honey, they’re holding.
Where are we?
Just crossed a hundred.
Gabe? Where are you?
Fuck.
You should probably dial in.
Yeah, I’ll be on in one sec.
I said certified freak / Seven days a week / Wet ass pussy / Make that pull-out game weak...
You fucking with some wet ass pussy
You fucking with some wet ass pussy
What.
Great news, Mr. Plotkin. I think we’ll be able to get you into your new home a little sooner--
I think we’re having a bit of a miscommunication here. I’m not trying to move into that house, I’m trying to TEAR IT DOWN so I can build a tennis court for my family to play during the pandemic. But the pandemic’s almost over, and there’s still no tennis court.
WHAT NOW.
