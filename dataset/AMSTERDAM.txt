## Script:

BURT BERENDSEN Where’s this going?
HAROLD WOODMAN It’s going to a particular

Just tell me what it is. What kind

flowers? Dinner date Dinner date Yes.

procedure?
Yes, he is, it’s OK.

 ELIZABETH MEEKINS He’s not gonna to do it.
HAROLD WOODMAN He’s gonna do it - calm down.
BURT BERENDSEN Who is this?
HAROLD WOODMAN This is Liz Meekins, Burt.
BURT BERENDSEN Meekins, as in relation to -?
ELIZABETH MEEKINS He’s my father. I know you admire
him very much.
HAROLD WOODMAN We both did - and do.
BURT BERENDSEN
I really do. That’s why he’s going to speak at our reunion this year.
Very nice to meet you. Are we meeting your father here?
HAROLD WOODMAN Let her finish, Burt.
ELIZABETH MEEKINS
My father came back yesterday on a
boat.
BURT BERENDSEN
OK. Goes to Europe on business,
right, did he catch a bug or something? I’ll look at him. Where is he?
HAROLD WOODMAN You should see him.
BURT BERENDSEN Yeah, come on. Let’s go.
HE FOLLOWS THEM DEEPER INTO A LARGE ROOM WITH A HIGH CEILING.
BURT BERENDSEN (CONT'D) This place is gorgeous.
THEY WALK TO A STOP AT THE END OF THE BIG ROOM.
5.

BURT BERENDSEN (CONT'D) So, where is the good General,
‘Quiet and Still Bill?’
SOMEONE OFF SCREEN BLOWS HER NOSE, GURNEY WHEELS SQUEAK.
A WOMAN AND ASSISTANT WHEEL IN AN OPEN CASKET OF BILL MEEKINS.
WOMAN MORTICIAN Excuse me, my allergies are
terrible today. I wake up, it’s in my sinus and it’s the whole day. I don’t know what you’re doing. I don’t want to know what you’re doing. You have two hours ‘til the embalmer comes.
Burt stares in shock at DEAD BILL MEEKINS.
BURT BERENDSEN
What happened? He was gonna speak
at the gala.
ELIZABETH MEEKINS You will help me, won’t you? I’m
not buying that he died of natural causes. He was a very healthy man. No one in my family agrees with me. They’re all wrong they’re all liars. I want an autopsy. It’s my right.
HAROLD WOODMAN
That’s correct, it is your right.
Your father died intestate. You’re the next of kin. I read the papers.
BURT BERENDSEN
I hate autopsies Harold, you know
that.
HAROLD WOODMAN
We have to do it, Burt. Bill Quiet and Still Meekins is the reason we
met. He formed our regiment.
BURT BERENDSEN
How did a man like this end up
dead? You’re telling me it’s suspicious?
