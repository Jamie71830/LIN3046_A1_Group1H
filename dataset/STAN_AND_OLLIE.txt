... so Madelyn turned up.
Madelyn turned up?
Completely out of the blue. Haven’t seen her in fifteen years...
There she was, all gussied up on the front door step. And that’s something I never thought I’d see again.
What’d she want?
Twenty thousand bucks.
Twenty thousand?
Fifteen years of back alimony. I said ‘what alimony? When we broke up I gave you whatever money I had and you took the car.’ We both agreed that was that.
Jeez even Mae wasn’t after that much - and she wanted me to pay for a chauffeur. It’s because our faces are plastered all over town. Probably some lawyer’s bright idea.
Well in any case I haven’t got it. Myrtle cleaned me out when we split.
You been down to Tijuana?
What makes you say that?
We had a few days off.
I did have a little run down there with Mysterious Montague yes, trying to win some back. Not... entirely successfully. Which reminds me. Would you do me favour, don’t talk money with Hal today.
Charlie, Buster, Harold - they get ten times what he pays us.
Well they own their own pictures.
Exactly. And that’s what we’re gonna do.
Hey boys how’s it goin’!
We’re just going shark fishing - Mr. Laurel doesn’t know it yet but he’s the bait.
How we gonna do that? We’re under contract, we can’t just change the terms.
We stick together, renegotiate with
Hal and get a slice of the pie. Or we walk and we set up on our own.
Oh I don’t know Stan. I’d love to own our pictures but it’s just not a good time for this. I have a lot going on, my overhead is killing me.
Ah Burgess, just the man. Take this to our friend, put it on Bold Venture, fourth race at Santa Anita. On the nose.
This is for you.
Hi Babe!
Do it now, it starts soon.
Okay. Thank you Mr. Hardy, Mr. Laurel.
Listen Babe we’ll be alright. Just lay off the horses and don’t get married again.
Oh that reminds me. I proposed to Lucille.
