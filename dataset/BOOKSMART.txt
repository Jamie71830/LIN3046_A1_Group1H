Maybe if I immediately lost all my limbs, and my eyesight and hearing, and I was just like a human potato. I’d be like, “remember when I had my limbs and could see and hear? Those were the best four years.”

 (CONT’D) Let’s just focus on getting through
the rest of the day without anything horrible happening, okay?
