Hi Joe. 
And honey, if you can, can you take all the plates and cups out...? 
All I ask is that’s she’s polite. Not sitting there with big movie star sunglasses, too good for everything. If she’s gonna be here, I want her to participate.
I’m sure she will. Look at this beautiful day.
Where you going?
 The roof.
A hard look.
I don’t want to call anybody’s mother today to say someone broke their neck and died.
 We’ll be so safe.
Charlie!
He slows and turns begrudgingly as the rest clomp up the stairs. He has a slight build, looks younger than his eighteen years.
Keep an eye on things for me, okay?
She wipes some mustard off his chin. He doesn’t resist but the look in his eyes is very clear.
She sighs dutifully at him and he hurries off.
Honestly.
Then suddenly a dark cloud overtakes Gracie’s expression, like something very terrible has just occurred to her.
I don’t think we have enough hot dogs.
I saw a movie she was in, a really
weird one, where she gets naked and does like a blood ritual. I couldn’t follow it.
Where’d you see it?
Just on TV.
Alright I looked up “Elizabeth Berry naked.”
I think that’s you.
Ben walks off. Joe flips the hot dogs, one by one.
Just one little second.
Hello.
Hi.
It’s such a pleasure to meet you.
Oh that’s sweet, we’re so happy to have you-- welcome!
Ignore the pool. Work-in-progress, right?
