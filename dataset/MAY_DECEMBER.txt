## Script: 

JOE Rhonda.
RHONDA Hi Joe.
GRACIE
And honey, if you can, can you take
all the plates and cups out...? (back to Rhonda)
All I ask is that’s she’s polite. Not sitting there with big movie star sunglasses, too good for everything. If she’s gonna be here, I want her to participate.
RHONDA
I’m sure she will. Look at this
beautiful day.
Joe holds the door for MARY & CHARLIE ATHERTON-YOO, 18 (”the twins”), as they run through the kitchen with their FRIENDS.
GRACIE Where you going?
MARY The roof.
A hard look.
GRACIE
I don’t want to call anybody’s
mother today to say someone broke their neck and died.
MARY We’ll be so safe.

 GRACIE (calling after)
Charlie!
He slows and turns begrudgingly as the rest clomp up the stairs. He has a slight build, looks younger than his eighteen years.
GRACIE (CONT’D)
Keep an eye on things for me, okay?
She wipes some mustard off his chin. He doesn’t resist but the look in his eyes is very clear.
She sighs dutifully at him and he hurries off.
Honestly.
GRACIE (CONT’D)
Then suddenly a dark cloud overtakes Gracie’s expression, like something very terrible has just occurred to her.
GRACIE (CONT’D)
I don’t think we have enough hot
dogs.
8 EXT. BACKYARD-- A BIT LATER 8 Joe mans the grill. There are so, so many hot dogs.
Kids and dogs are running around playing. Adults drink.
He stands with his friend BEN, 40s, suburban dad.
BEN
I saw a movie she was in, a really
weird one, where she gets naked and does like a blood ritual. I couldn’t follow it.
JOE Where’d you see it?
BEN Just on TV.
Joe rolls his eyes.
BEN (CONT’D) Alright I looked up “Elizabeth
Berry naked.”
A CHILD SCREAMS A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM--the men turn.
(CONTINUED)
4.

 But it’s fine: a TODDLER just fell and starts crying.
JOE
I think that’s you.
Ben walks off. Joe flips the hot dogs, one by one.
A9 EXT. CATALINA DRIVE--DAY
POV through windshield: passing oaks with drooping the green marsh landscape turn to shady homes from and ‘80s.
9 EXT. ATHERTON-YOO HOUSE-- DAY
Elizabeth’s rental car settles opposite the split-level house nestled behind three palms. It sports a coral pink entry and a tall sloping roof. Elizabeth approaches, now in a carefree summer dress, carrying a bottle of wine from the gift basket.
No one hears her front-door knock.
She picks up a BROWN-PAPER PACKAGE (about the size of a shoebox) sitting on the step, and heads around the side, following the playful noises.
10 EXT. BACKYARD-- CONTINUOUS 10
The barbecue is in full swing. A touch football game going on, the teens sprawled out on the roof. Casual clothes, sporting red, white, or blue.
Joe, still manning the grill, is the first to see Elizabeth. She steps into the sunlight in a way that makes her glow, a pleasant smile on her face.
Elizabeth scans the crowd, where she finds Gracie, on the deck, holding a big strawberry cake, already staring right at her with a big, warm smile.
Elizabeth approaches her as she lays the cake down on a table of many cakes.
GRACIE
Just one little second.
She adjusts it, and turns to Elizabeth.
Hello.
GRACIE (CONT’D)
A9
moss along the ‘70s

ELIZABETH
Hi.
She puts her hand to her heart.
ELIZABETH (CONT’D) It’s such a pleasure to meet you.
GRACIE
Oh that’s sweet, we’re so happy to
have you-- welcome!
She motions to the party. Her eye catches the empty pool under construction off to the side, with about an inch of rusty-looking water.
GRACIE (CONT’D)
Ignore the pool. Work-in-progress,
right?
ELIZABETH
Always.
