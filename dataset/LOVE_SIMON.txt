Hey, Nora made pancakes.
Cool. Be down soon.
And by "soon" do you mean once you finish searching for pictures of Gigi Habib in lingerie?
It's Hadid.
Sorry, didn't realize she was your girlfriend.
Yup, you got me.
Simon, sit. Breakfast is--
Please mom, don't say breakfast is the most important meal of the day. It's so cliche. You're better than that.
I was going to say breakfast lowers LDL cholesterol and prevents fluctuating glucose levels which can lead to type two diabetes. Is that cliche?
Touche.
Nora, this is incredible.
Oh, thanks. They're cornmeal with blackberry compote. No big deal.
Here you go, Bieber. Most important meal of the day.
Ahh!
Homeroom starts in eighteen minutes.
Shit. I fell asleep studying Roberto Baggio's moves in the '94 World Cup.
Damnit. Now I know who won.
Did you buy that for your dad?
He bought it for himself. It was at the peak of his mid-life crisis.
I was just having the craziest dream.
Nick, you have the "craziest dream" every night.
I was in the bathroom putting on my contacts.
But I couldn't figure out which lens went in which eye--
Wait for Leah.
We never should've told you about ESPN Classic.
Sorry we can't all make our own clothes.
Seriously though, that dress is really cool. You're gonna be very rich one day.
Maybe we can collaborate on a clothing line, like H & Mand Beckham.
And then Si will write a profile about us in some fancy magazine.
I love how successful we are in the pretend future.
