MICHAEL I'm Michael Gavey.
5.
 6. Oliver looks at his hand for a second, then shakes it.
OLIVER Oliver.
MICHAEL Oliver what?
OLIVER Oliver Quick.
MICHAEL
So you're a norman-no-mates too
then, Oliver Quick?
OLIVER
Isn't everyone? It's only the first
night.
MICHAEL Er...look around you.
Oliver looks at the other tables. Everyone is having a ball.
MICHAEL (CONT’D)
It's just you and me, mate. And the girl with agoraphobia, but she's in
her room. Obviously. What you reading?
Err -
OLIVER
MICHAEL I'm reading Maths.
(matter of fact)
I'm a genius... I don't even like maths really. I can just do it. In my head. Anything. Ask me a sum.
OLIVER Nah, you're ok.
MICHAEL Come on.
OLIVER
It’s...It’s not like I don’t
believe you.
MICHAEL Please. Come on.

 Beat.
OLIVER Nah, I believe you.
MICHAEL
FUCKING ASK ME A SUM THEN.
OLIVER
Uhh... Four hundred and twenty
three times seventy eight.
MICHAEL (immediately)
Thirty two thousand nine hundred and ninety four.
They sit in awkward silence.
INT. PROFESSOR WARE'S ROOM - LATER
Oliver sits on a cracked leather armchair in a room almost comically crammed with books. Opposite him is PROFESSOR WARE (50s), a coffee-stained man who is really only in this job for the free port and cheese.
They've clearly been waiting a while. Finally-
Beat.
PROFESSOR WARE
So, how are you finding Oxford?
OLIVER
Good. Yeah, good, thanks.
PROFESSOR WARE
Did you come from far? From home?
OLIVER Um. Prescot?
PROFESSOR WARE ...Yeah, where?
OLIVER Prescot. Merseyside.
PROFESSOR WARE
Ah. Never been. Never been...
Prescot. Hmmm. Another painful beat.
7.

 PROFESSOR WARE (CONT’D) So, how did you get on with the
summer reading list?
OLIVER
Yeah. Ok I think. I read it all.
PROFESSOR WARE (incredulous)
All of it? Fifty books on there! Are you mad?
OLIVER
I thought we were supposed to-
PROFESSOR WARE
The King James Bible is on there!
Are you telling me you spent your summer reading the Bible? The reading list is optional! I've not read half the books on there!
OLIVER Sorry.
They collapse into another long silence.
PROFESSOR WARE
Any idea where he's got to? He’s
twenty minutes late now.
Oliver shakes his head. Ware looks at the clock: 3:20.
PROFESSOR WARE (CONT’D) I suppose we'd better start then-
Suddenly the door crashes open and Farleigh appears, monstrously hungover, last night's glitter on his face. He flashes Ware a disarming smile.
FARLEIGH
I'm so sorry. Sorry I’m late. Sorry
I’m late. I’m so sorry. I got completely lost.
Farleigh throws himself down on an armchair.
FARLEIGH (CONT’D) (to Oliver)
Hi, nice to meet you. (back on Ware)
I’m sorry.
8.

 PROFESSOR WARE
You're Farleigh Start, I take it?
Nice of you to join us, finally. (a sudden thought)
You’re not a relation of Frederica Start by any chance?
FARLEIGH She's my mother.
Ware breaks out into a soppy grin.
PROFESSOR WARE
No! I knew her when I was your age.
When we were both here! When she was still Frederica Catton. Before she went to America.
FARLEIGH
No way! Oh, my God. I'll tell her.
She’s gonna be thrilled I'm being tutored by one of her friends!
PROFESSOR WARE (flustered)
Oh no no. Not, uh, friend. More an admirer. From afar. I'm not sure we ever...spoke. No... don't even mention me.
Farleigh smiles charmingly. Easily taking charge of the room.
FARLEIGH Shall we start?
INT. PROFESSOR WARE'S ROOM - LATER
Oliver is reading from an essay he wrote. The clock now reads 3:55 and he is just coming to the end.
OLIVER
And thus the shape of the verse can
be said, like Browning's "Last Duchess", to look as if it "were alive".
Oliver looks up at his tutor expectantly. Ware is staring out of the window, zoned out. He suddenly realizes he is expected to talk.
9.

PROFESSOR WARE
Okay, yeah. Very good. Yeah. A lot
of food for thought there. Intriguing. Hmmmm.
Oliver looks at him: is that it? Farleigh chuckles.
Beat.
Why?
OLIVER
"Thus".
FARLEIGH
OLIVER (sharp)
Hmmm?
FARLEIGH
Sorry, just "thus". It's just a
funny word.
FARLEIGH
I don’t know. I don’t think we
really use it in real life, do we? It's kind of verbose, don't you think?
OLIVER No. Not really.
FARLEIGH
No... No, you don't. You used it
seven times.
