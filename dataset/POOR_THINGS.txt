Good night.
Do you know I am actually something of a romantic Max?
What? I-.
I believe I see love between you and Bella.
I... what? I... she is...
Perhaps you should marry her?
What?
I think she loves you.
I have seen people look at each other with love, as an observer
never a subject of course. I see it.
You do? I do have feelings.
So you would?
Bella... I...
Oh.
Feel funny?
I wondered if perhaps you were raising her to be your mistress, a dark thought unworthy of me I know. So you are not laying with her.
Spermatic ejaculation can only
induce homeostasis in me if accompanied by prolonged stimulation of higher nerve centres whose pressure upon the ductless glands changes the chemistry of my blood not for a few spasmodic minutes but for many days.
 What?
I am a eunuch and can’t fuck her.
To get a sexual response from my body would take the same amount of electricity as runs North London. Besides my paternal feelings seem to outweigh my sexual thoughts.
I apologise for my own dark
thoughts.
Not dark at all. Men’s, indeed all
sexuality, is basically amoral.
Do you wish to marry her or not?
I wish to marry you. Be my wife.
Ow! Let us touch each other’s genital pieces.
No. I do not wish to take advantage of you. You are... special. When we are wed.
One condition.
