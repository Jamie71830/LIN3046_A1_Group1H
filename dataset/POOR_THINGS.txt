## Script:

BELLA Good night.
Gets up and exits.
A burbling sound rips from Baxter’s stomach. He opens his mouth a large bubble appears and is released. They watch it for a moment and it floats and lands on the table and bursts.
BAXTER
Do you know I am actually something
of a romantic Max?
MAX What? I-.
BAXTER
I believe I see love between you
and Bella.
MAX
I... what? I... she is...
BAXTER
Perhaps you should marry her?
MAX What?
 Poor Things - Final Cut 20.
BAXTER
I think she loves you.
36 INT BAXTER’S HOUSE DRAWING ROOM - DAY 36
Bella tossing strawberries high in the air. Max runs frantically from one side of the room to the other to catch each in his mouth.
Baxter watches them as Max falls and Bella laughs.
BAXTER V/O
I have seen people look at each other with love, as an observer
never a subject of course. I see it.
37 INT BAXTER’S HOUSE DINING ROOM 37
MAX
You do? I do have feelings.
BAXTER So you would?
38 INT BAXTER’S HOUSE DRAWING ROOM 38
BELLA Take Bella out.
MAX Bella... I...
She licks his ear suddenly.
MAX (CONT’D)
Oh.
She laughs. Does it a again, faster, it affects him.
BELLA Feel funny?
He nods. She leans her head to him.
Do Bella. BELLA (CO NT’D)
He reluctantly licks her ear. Slowly. She laughs.

39 INT BAXTER’S HOUSE DINING ROOM 39
MAX
I wondered if perhaps you were
raising her to be your mistress, a dark thought unworthy of me I know. So you are not laying with her.
BAXTER
Spermatic ejaculation can only
induce homeostasis in me if accompanied by prolonged stimulation of higher nerve centres whose pressure upon the ductless glands changes the chemistry of my blood not for a few spasmodic minutes but for many days.
MAX What?
BAXTER
I am a eunuch and can’t fuck her.
To get a sexual response from my body would take the same amount of electricity as runs North London. Besides my paternal feelings seem to outweigh my sexual thoughts.
40 EXT BAXTER’S HOUSE GARDEN - DAY 40
An enclosed courtyard, Bella is staring up at the sky. A Pig/dog and a duck/goats mill about.
MAX V/O
I apologise for my own dark
thoughts.
BAXTER V/O
Not dark at all. Men’s, indeed all
sexuality, is basically amoral.
MAX V/O Not all sir!
BAXTER V/O
Do you wish to marry her or not?
Max approaches Bella in the garden.
MAX
I wish to marry you. Be my wife.
She smiles, he goes to kiss her, hits her teeth.

BELLA
Ow! Let us touch each other’s
genital pieces.
MAX
No. I do not wish to take advantage
of you. You are... special. When we are wed.
She nods, slightly annoyed.

22.
BAXTER One condition.
MAX
She must desire it also, I
understand.
BAXTER
Two conditions then. That one you
said and you must live here with me always. I will have a legal agreement drawn up.
Bella looks at the windows. Notices the new locks on them. She punches the window. Growls. Hits the window.
45 INT BAXTER’S STUDY - DAY 45
Duncan is at the office. Baxter peruses the papers. Duncan sips at a glass of port.
DUNCAN Curious contract.
BAXTER
Hmmm. There are several spelling
errors.
DUNCAN
Oh... immaterial to the legal
bindingness of it I assure you. (MORE)
