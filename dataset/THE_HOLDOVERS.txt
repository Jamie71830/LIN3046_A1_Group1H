## Script:

CRANDALL
Oooh, look out everyone. Tully’s
going to St. Kitts. They still look like panties.
Crandall walks away, still brushing his teeth.
ANGUS
Yeah, you’re right, Crandall, you
caught me. It’s your mother’s panties. Tell her thanks for the good times.
Hostile TEDDY KOUNTZE, 16, comes by in his robe.
KOUNTZE
Hey, Tully, where are my
cigarettes?
ANGUS Your cigarettes?
KOUNTZE
You stole my fucking cigarettes.
ANGUS
I resent that baseless accusation.
KOUNTZE
Cut the shit. I have no
cigarettes, and Briggs says you suddenly have five of them to trade for a skin mag.
ANGUS
I don’t indulge in pornography. I
get enough of the real thing. Especially with Crandall’s mom!
HANS HARRIMAN approaches with a small bag of pot.
HARRIMAN
Kountze, ten dollars is too much for
this. Looks more like a nickel bag.
ANGUS
Yeah, don’t buy that, Harriman. He’s
ripping you off. Plus, that’s ditch weed.
KOUNTZE
Fuck you, Tully. This shit’s
premium weed. (MORE)

 KOUNTZE (CONT’D)
And unlike you, I’m stuck here, so
it’s gotta last me through Christmas.
ANGUS
Yeah, take pity on him, Harriman.
He’s a poor little Christmas orphan with nowhere to go. Little Christmas orphan needs his pot and porn.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Head cook MARY LAMB leads half a dozen KITCHEN WORKERS toiling over an industrial-sized range, stirring oatmeal, scrambling eggs and frying bacon.
MARY
Ten minutes, ladies. Ten minutes!
Mary glances up from her work to notice the snow falling outside the window.
EXT. QUAD - DAY
Bundled up against the cold in a time-worn duffle coat, pipe between his teeth, Paul briskly crosses the snowy campus. Boys race past him toward the dining hall.
INT. DINING HALL - DAY
A grand room -- high ceiling, animal trophies -- teeming with hungry boys.
AT THE MASTERS’ TABLE
Professors ROSENSWEIG and ENDICOTT eat breakfast.
ROSENSWIEG
I can’t believe you got out of it.
ENDICOTT Luck of the Irish.
ROSENSWIEG
I thought this was your year.
ENDICOTT
It was. I told Woodrup my mother
has lupus.
5

 Does she?
ROSENSWIEG
ENDICOTT
I don’t know. Probably. We don’t
talk about those things.
ROSENSWIEG
So who’s getting stuck with it?
ENDICOTT Who do you think?
Endicott glances at an empty chair.
ROSENSWIEG
That poor walleyed bastard.
INT. HEADMASTER’S OFFICE - DAY
Large and stately. Portraits of past headmasters.
Paul stands before an acre of desk. DR. HARDY WOODRUP, late 40s, sits writing a list and smoking. His wardrobe may be Brooks Bros, but his beard says 1970.
Paul’s eyes settle on a crystal bottle of COGNAC tied with ribbon.
DR. WOODRUP (noticing)
Remy Martin, Louis XIII. Christmas gift from the Board of Trustees.
PAUL
How generous of them.
DR. WOODRUP
Thank you again for doing this,
Hunham. I wouldn’t have asked if it weren’t an emergency.
PAUL
Mr. Endicott’s mother. Right.
What a tragedy.
DR. WOODRUP
It’s not as though you had plans to
leave campus anyway. And of course there’s a nice little bonus in it for you.

PAUL
Well. Non nobis solum nati sumus,
I suppose.
