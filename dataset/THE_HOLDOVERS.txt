Oooh, look out everyone. Tully’s going to St. Kitts. They still look like panties.
Yeah, you’re right, Crandall, you caught me. It’s your mother’s panties. Tell her thanks for the good times.
Hey, Tully, where are my cigarettes?
Your cigarettes?
You stole my fucking cigarettes.
I resent that baseless accusation.
Cut the shit. I have no cigarettes, and Briggs says you suddenly have five of them to trade for a skin mag.
I don’t indulge in pornography. I get enough of the real thing. Especially with Crandall’s mom!
Kountze, ten dollars is too much for this. Looks more like a nickel bag.
Yeah, don’t buy that, Harriman. He’s ripping you off. Plus, that’s ditch weed.
Fuck you, Tully. This shit’s premium weed. 
And unlike you, I’m stuck here, so
it’s gotta last me through Christmas.
Yeah, take pity on him, Harriman.
He’s a poor little Christmas orphan with nowhere to go. Little Christmas orphan needs his pot and porn.
Ten minutes, ladies. Ten minutes!
I can’t believe you got out of it.
Luck of the Irish.
I thought this was your year.
It was. I told Woodrup my mother has lupus.
Does she?
I don’t know. Probably. We don’t talk about those things.
So who’s getting stuck with it?
Who do you think?
Endicott glances at an empty chair.
That poor walleyed bastard.
How generous of them.
Thank you again for doing this,
Hunham. I wouldn’t have asked if it weren’t an emergency.
Mr. Endicott’s mother. Right.
